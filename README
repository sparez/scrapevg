Scrapevg is a simple tool for scraping SVG images from web pages and save them
to file.
It uses PhantomJS for rendering web pages, thus being able to scrape SVG images
generated client side.

Sample usage:

$> scrapevg http://www.example.com/page-with-svg-images.html /directory/where/to/save/svg/files

The software is not yet submitted as a gem, so to run it in the meantime please install phantomjs and the gems phantomjs.rb and nokogiri, then type:

$> cd /your/scrapevg/directory
$> ruby -Ilib bin/scrapevg <web page url> <target directory>
